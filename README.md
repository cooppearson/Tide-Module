#Tide-Module

It's a Tide Ad

How to run:

- Open a new Terminal/Command shell

- cd (Change Directories) into Tide-Module folder

- Type "sh startClock.sh" into your shell and run the shell script file

- Voila!

- If you're feeling lazy, you only need to type "sh st" and then tabbing should autocomplete the filename for you
